      <description>I was provided with a series of csv files about the banking habits of customers: information about their chequing accounts, saving accounts and general other transaction data. I was also given information about the demographics of the customers - generic descriptors such as age, marital status, yearly income, gender and city/state.
At this point i had to clean the data i was provided with - find and rectify typos in the messy data, impute missing values, encode the categorical variables and so on.</description>
